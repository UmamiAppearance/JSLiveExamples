# JSLiveExamples
Create HTML live examples to demonstrate JavaScript code in action

## Idea
There are countless JavaScript packages out there. For the developer it is always a lot of work to think about how to present it to a possible user. A lot of times apart from the documentation and/or readme file one has to rely on third party services to show live examples to demonstrate the code in action. **JSLiveExamples** makes it possible to keep the creation of live examples inside of your github repository (or whatever service which is able to serve html [like GithubPages]).  
  
A JSLiveExample is just a little template which gets inserted into the HTML code at the place where the example should be, the rest is done by the JavaScript application.  
  
The user can see, change and run the provide code, the console output gets logged to. Watch the [demo](https://umamiappearance.github.io/JSLiveExamples/examples/demo.html).
